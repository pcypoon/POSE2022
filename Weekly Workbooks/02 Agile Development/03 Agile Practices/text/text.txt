These high level values and preferences may well be provoking and inspirational, but they don't actually explain HOW you should go about adhering to the Agile methodology. To help us apply Agile principles in our day-to-day development activities, Agile methods advocate a number of key "Practices" that developers can adopt in their work. View the slides and video linked to above for an overview of some of the most common Agile practices. The slides also outline a number of "Anti-practices" - common developer behaviours that go _against_ the principles of Agile (and as such should be avoided in your development processes).
