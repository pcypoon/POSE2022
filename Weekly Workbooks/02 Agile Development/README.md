## Agile Development
### <a href='https://web.microsoftstream.com/group/47ff5be4-af38-493f-a1c8-650acc485651?view=videos' target='_blank'> Weekly Briefing ![](../../resources/icons/briefing.png) </a>
### Task 1: Introduction


In the previous workbook, we considered development processes at a very high level of abstraction. In this week's workbook, our discussion becomes a lot more specific as we focus on a particular class of development methodologies known as "Agile".  


# 
### Task 2: Agile Manifesto
 <a href='02%20Agile%20Manifesto/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='02%20Agile%20Manifesto/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

View the slides and video above for an overview of the Agile methodology. In particular you will find out about the Agile "Manifesto" and the "values" that it promotes. Agile is driven by the needs of developers and as such the methodology reflects the likes and dislikes of typical development staff. Based on your experience of software development so far, rate the activities in <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUOU1NS1BaNFhHS1c0Nk9PMlpSVUpQUjNCVS4u" target="_blank">this week's online form</a> in order of the satisfaction you gain from them.

### Task 3: Agile Practices
 <a href='03%20Agile%20Practices/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='03%20Agile%20Practices/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

These high level values and preferences may well be provoking and inspirational, but they don't actually explain HOW you should go about adhering to the Agile methodology. To help us apply Agile principles in our day-to-day development activities, Agile methods advocate a number of key "Practices" that developers can adopt in their work. View the slides and video linked to above for an overview of some of the most common Agile practices. The slides also outline a number of "Anti-practices" - common developer behaviours that go _against_ the principles of Agile (and as such should be avoided in your development processes).  


# 
### Task 4: Pair Programming
 <a href='04%20Pair%20Programming/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='04%20Pair%20Programming/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

We have already mentioned the concept of "Pair Programming" as being a key Agile practice. This is a very useful technique that can be applied directly in your work (especially if you are planning on doing a group project over the summer !). View the slides and video linked to above to gain a deeper understanding of this particular practice.

Now watch <a href="media/Pair-Programming.mp4" target="_blank">this example of pair programming</a> (taken from a Bloomberg example interview video). Note that you do not need to try to understand the problem the two developers are trying to solve, nor do you need to be able to read and interpret the code that they are writing. Your objective is just to simply observes and appreciate the high-level _activities_ involved in peer programming.

Whilst watching the video, make a note of the strategies that the "navigator" is using to help guide the "driver". At the end of the video, visit the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUOU1NS1BaNFhHS1c0Nk9PMlpSVUpQUjNCVS4u" target="_blank">online form</a> and enter at least three useful actions the "navigator" has taken during the sample exercise. We will discuss the various suggestions submitted during the next live teaching session. To give you an idea of the type strategies we are looking for, an example of a useful navigator practice might be:
```
Asking the "driver" to reiterate the problem to ensure both developers have a shared understanding.
```
  


# 
### Task 5: Bad Pair Programming


Now that you have an understanding of GOOD strategies for pair programming, it is also useful to know about BAD practices. Watch <a href="media/Pair-Programming-Anti-Patterns.mp4" target="_blank">this video</a> about pair programming "Anti-Patterns" (things to avoid). As you watch the video, think about if you have ever been guilty of these bad practices. Although this video is supposed to be "fun" it does make a serious point about pair programming - you should be careful not to fall into these common traps !  


# 
### Task 6: Kanban Boards
 <a href='06%20Kanban%20Boards/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='06%20Kanban%20Boards/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Maintaining a "Kanban" boards is a common practice in many Agile methods. Take a look at the slides and video linked to above to gain an understanding of the structure and operation of such boards. The video illustrates the use of Kanban boards using a popular project management tool called "Jira" - this is just one of many Kanban board systems available (you might also have heard of "Trello" and "Monday.com" !)

You are not currently working on a project of any significant size that we might use as a basis for a Kanban board activity. Instead, let us play a simple game in order to give you some first-hand experience of using the Kanban boards provided by GitHub. This game involves you answering general knowledge questions posed by students on the unit, as well as setting your own questions for other people to answer.

Visit the <a href="https://github.com/pose-uob/POSE2022/projects/1" target="_blank">Google Quest Kanban Board</a> that we have created for you on the POSE GitHub repository. Note that you will need to be a member of the POSE Github organisation in order to access this page ! Using the Kanban board, perform the following actions:

1. Add a new "note" to the "What I really want to know is..." column by clicking on the `+` button
2. Enter a suitable question (that you'd like someone else to answer)
3. Convert the "note" into an "issue" by clicking on the `...` button and selecting "Convert to issue"
4. Pick an existing "issue" (_not_ one of your own) from the "What I really want to know is..." column 
5. Move your chosen issue into the "Under investigation" column
6. Assign yourself to the issue (so that everyone knows you have chosen it)
7. Search the internet to find an appropriate answer to the question
8. Enter your answer in the "comments" section of the issue
9. When finished, click the "Close issue" button (which should move it into the "Resolved" column)
  


# 
### Task 7: Agile in Perspective
 <a href='07%20Agile%20in%20Perspective/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='07%20Agile%20in%20Perspective/slides/segment-2.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='07%20Agile%20in%20Perspective/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a> <a href='07%20Agile%20in%20Perspective/video/segment-2.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Although much of this workbook has presented Agile in a positive light, there are various problems and challenges in applying such approaches to the development of complex software systems. View the slides and video linked to above to gain an insight into these difficulties. You should always try to bear these issues in mind when undertaking a development project in order to avoid running into unnecessary difficulties. Although Agile is popular, it is not always the answer !  


# 
### Task 8: Final Thoughts


In this workbook we have introduced some of the common characteristics and practices of Agile development. We have looked in some level of detail at two of these (namely Pair Programming and Kanban boards). In later workbooks will we get the opportunity to explore some of the other practices that we introduced, but didn't fully explore in this workbook.
