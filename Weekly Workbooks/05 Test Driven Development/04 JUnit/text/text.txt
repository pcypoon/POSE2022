A challenge with testing the previously presented IMDB rating code is that it maintains _persistent state_ over time (namely, it keeps a record of the average rating and the number of ratings submitted). This causes extra challenges for unit testing, since we need to determine whether or not the method operates correctly _for a sequence of values_. In order to fully test the above code, we therefore need to test it in operation over a period of time, calling the method multiple times with suitable test values.

Luckily there is a testing framework called "JUnit" that can help us achieve this (which you have already been using as part of the Java unit). View the slides and video above to find out more about JUnit (sorry about the rant about C halfway through ;o). Once you are happy with the concepts, your job is to should write some suitable JUnit test cases to exercise the IMDB rating code.

To help you in this task, we have created a <a href="https://github.com/pose-uob/IMDBRating" target="_blank">Java Maven project</a> which contains the previously shown IMDB rating code. You should **fork** this repository in order to create your own version of the project on GitHub (you will need your own repository for a later task !). Once you have a forked copy of the repository on GitHub, clone this to create a local copy to work on.

As you will recall from the Java unit, there is a `test` folder inside the `src` directory of the project where all test scripts should be located. Edit the `IMDBRatingTest` class that is contained in the test folder, adding a number of JUnit tests that will fully test the average rating code. These tests should make a number of calls to the average rating method, passing in a sequence of values in order to test out the operation of the persistent state.

There is in fact a fault in the average rating code which your test cases should hopefully identify. Once you have determined the nature of this fault, devise a revision to the code (and check to make sure that it does indeed fix the fault !). Finally, enter your revised line of code into the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMVlKNjVCRkU2NTlRWU5RSVkxRlE1Qlc3WC4u" target="_blank">weekly workbook form</a>.
