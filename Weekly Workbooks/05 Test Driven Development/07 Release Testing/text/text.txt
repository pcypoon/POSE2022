Release testing (often called "Integration testing") operates at a higher level than the lower-level unit testing we discussed earlier. The aim of release testing is to test the system _as an integrated whole_ and thereby ensure that it is ready for release to a client. This requires addition test cases to be written and executed, verifying complex application features at a higher "whole-system" level (rather than just checking the operation of individual functions at a component/unit level).

Review the slides and video linked to above to gain an appreciation of release testing. We will then attempt to perform release testing on the IMDB example application. The problem is that we don't actually have access to the entire IMDB codebase ! We can however target the existing live IMDB website as a "black box" that we can run tests against. Your task is to write a release test that will exercise the IMDB "advanced search" facility to ensure it is working correctly. More specifically, you should assess the correctness of the "filming locations" search provided by IMDB. As a test case, you should request a report of all films and TV shows that have been filmed in the Bristol area. This can be done by requesting the following URL:

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title-text/?location=bristol" target="_blank">https://www.imdb.com/search/title-text/?location=bristol</a>

As you can see (if you clicked on the link above) the query returns a large number of films and TV shows. You could manually check the results of this query by looking at the returned web page, however this goes against the whole ethos of automated test-driven development. Instead, we will write a JUnit test that requests this URL from the server and then analyses the response in order to check that it is correct.

To confirm the completeness of the IMDB database and to ensure that the querying features are operating correctly, we need a test case of "known correct" data. In this case, you should check that ALL episodes of the classic Bristol-based TV detective drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoestring_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Shoestring</a> are listed in the search results. You will need to refine the query URL, otherwise you will get back _anything_ that was _ever_ shot in Bristol. The easiest way to do this is to add the ID of the leading actor from Shoestring (Trevor Eve, ID: nm0263368) to the end of the URL:

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=bristol&role=nm0263368" target="_blank">https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=bristol&role=nm0263368</a>

This will return everything that was shot in Bristol AND stars Trevor Eve (the results of which are _mostly_ just episodes of Shoestring). For a full list of episode titles to check against, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoestring_(TV_series)#Episodes" target="_blank">Shoestring entry on wikipedia</a>.
