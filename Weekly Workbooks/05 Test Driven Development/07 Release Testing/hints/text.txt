A simple (if fairly rudimentary) way to make HTTP requests from a Java application (or JUnit test script) is by using the `HttpURLConnection` class. We can use this to call the HTTP request handlers provided by an application, and then use assertions as normal to test the response received.

For example, we can use the following code to query IMDB and read in the response returned from the server:

```java
URL url = new URL("https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=bristol&role=nm0263368");
HttpURLConnection connection =(HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
connection.setDoOutput(true);
connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
InputStream stream = connection.getInputStream();
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stream));
String nextLine = reader.readLine();
while(nextLine != null) {
    // Check the line to see what it contains
    ?????????????????????????????????????????
    nextLine = reader.readLine();
}
```

Note that you will need to import some classes and catch some exceptions in order to get the above code to work !
