We have created at outline UML class diagram for a section of the Kegworth aircraft flight control system. We have provided you with this diagram in the form of a <a href="templates/class-diagram.dot" target="_blank">graphviz document</a> (note that you might like to use <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/" target="_blank">this online tool</a> to view the rendered version of the diagram). As you can see from the diagram, there are some elements missing - as indicated by the `???` placeholders. In particular, two of the class names are missing. Edit the graphviz document, replacing the relevant two `???` placeholders with the correct class names. Ensure that you only change the `???` elements and don't alter any of the structure or content of the rest of the document.
