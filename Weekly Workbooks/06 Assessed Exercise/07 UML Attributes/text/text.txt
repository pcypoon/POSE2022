You may also have noticed when viewing the previously provided UML class diagram document, that two of the class attributes are missing. Edit the graphviz document, replacing the `???` elements with appropriate attributes. You should pick the most appropriate attributes from the following list (don't invent ones of your own !):

- `cockpit: Cockpit`
- `lights: WarningLight[]`
- `engine: Engine`
- `sensors: sensorDevice[]`
- `sensor: VibrationSensor`
- `lever: ThrottleLever`
- `engines: Engine[]`
- `throttle: AutoThrottle`
- `gauge: VibrationGauge`

Ensure that you only change the `???` elements and don't alter any of the structure or content of the rest of the document.
