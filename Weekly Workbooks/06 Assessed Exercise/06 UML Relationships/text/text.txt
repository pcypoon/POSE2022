You may have noticed when viewing the previously provided UML class diagram document that many of the relationship arrowheads are not shown. Reopen the previous graphviz document and edit the "relationships" section, replacing all of the `???` elements with the correct arrow style - replacing them with `vee`, `empty` or `odiamond` depending on the nature of the relationship. See the workbook on Object Oriented Design for a mapping between UML relationship types and Graphviz arrowhead styles. Ensure that you only change the `???` elements and don't alter any of the structure or content of the rest of the document.
