Once you have completed all of the activities outlined above, you must submit all 7 documents in a zip file onto the submission point on Blackboard. Please use zip, rather than any other archiving file format as this will make the marking process easier. Please don't change the names of the files, otherwise it will make it difficult to identify which files belong to which tasks. Finally, make sure you submit your completed files (rather than the originals which contain all of the `???` placeholders !)
