You may also have noticed when viewing the previously provided UML class diagram document, that five of the methods are missing. Edit the graphviz document, replacing the `???` elements with appropriate methods. You should pick the most appropriate methods from the following list (don't invent ones of your own !):

- `flashWarningLight(id, rate): void`
- `setFuelFlowRate(rate): void`
- `setEngineThrust(): void`
- `setGaugeValue(id, value): void`
- `getVibrationReading(): float`
- `getCurrentReading(): float`
- `getSensorDevices(): void`
- `getLeverPosition(): float`
- `engageAutoThrottle(): void`
- `getThrustReading(): float`



Ensure that you only change the `???` elements and don't alter any of the structure or content of the rest of the document.
