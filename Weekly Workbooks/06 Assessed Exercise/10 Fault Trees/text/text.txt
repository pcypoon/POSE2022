In this task you will get the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the Kegworth case study. A template <a href="templates/fault-tree.dot" target="_blank">fault tree diagram</a> has been provided for you which deconstructs the causes of the accident into a tree of contributing factors. You will have noticed that this fault tree is however not complete. It is your task to edit the document, replacing the `???` elements with appropriate faults, errors and failures. You should pick the most appropriate items from the following list to replace the `???` placeholders (don't invent ones of your own !):

- `Competition`
- `Profit motive`
- `UK Government`
- `Engine Failure`
- `Flight Simulator`
- `Failed Regulation`
- `Incomplete Testing`
- `No Power to Enforce`
- `Incorrect Diagnosis`
- `Engine Test Results`
- `Failure of Training`
- `Promotional Materials`
- `Cameras not Installed`
- `Constant Interruptions`
- `Training not Questioned`
- `Rejected Recommendations`
- `Vibration Gauge too Small`
- `Inadequate Training Materials`
- `Institute of Aviation Medicine`
- `Lack of User-centred Evaluation`

Ensure that you only change the `???` elements and don't alter any of the structure or content of the rest of the document.
