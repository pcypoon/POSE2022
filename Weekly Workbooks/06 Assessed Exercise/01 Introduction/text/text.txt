This is an **ASSESSED** workbook !  
The activities in this workbook will constitute 50% of your mark for this unit.  
You should work your way through the tasks, completing each in turn. Each task will require you to complete a template document, which you will then need to submit onto blackboard by the deadline. We strongly advise you to pull the repository as normal, but then _move_ the templates to another folder to work on them (there is the danger that subsequent pulls will overwrite your changes - if you leave the files in the same location !). Many of the documents will be auto-marked, so it is important that you do not change the structure or formatting of the material they contain. In each section you will be instructed as to which elements you should add or update.
