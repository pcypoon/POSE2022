In this task we will explore the broader context of the Kegworth accident in order to better understand the behaviours of the various parties involved. In particular, you will get the opportunity to assess the professional practice of key stakeholders in order to determine whether they acted responsibly and ethically. Open and edit <a href="templates/professional.md" target="_blank">this professional practices table</a>. Enter an `x` in each column where you believe the individual or organisation committed bad professional practice (leave the column blank if you feel they were not guilty of that particular bad practice). Do not change any other content or formatting in the document.
