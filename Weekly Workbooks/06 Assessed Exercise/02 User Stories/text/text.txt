The aim of this first activity is to identify a set of valid User Stories for the civil aviation sector (as illustrated in the Kegworth case study). Open and edit <a href="templates/user-stories.md" target="_blank">this user story table</a> in order to indicate which are valid User Stories and which are not. Note that you should consider these User Stories from the perspective of civil aviation in general (i.e. do not limit your analysis to just what occurred in the "Kegworth" accident). For each row in the table insert an `x` in _either_ the "Valid" or the "Invalid" column. Do not change any other content or formatting.
