As you will have seen from viewing the slides in the previous section, there are a lot of diagrams and notations within the Unified Modelling Language. When creating design documents for a software system, we _could_ use a general purpose graphical editor (such as Photoshop) to create UML diagrams. This would however require us as designers to recall and apply all of the correct graphical notations. For this reason, it is more common for developers to use a purpose-built UML editor (or UML plugin to a general purpose editor).

<a href="https://products.office.com/en/visio/" target="_blank">Microsoft Visio</a> is one commercially available tool that supports the UML standard notation. <a href="https://www.umlet.com/" target="_blank">Umlet</a> on the other hand is a popular open-source alternative for developers on a tight budget. There are also numerous plugins for different IDEs (such as Eclipse, IntelliJ etc.). In this workbook we will however be making use of an open source graphical platform called <a href="https://graphviz.org/" target="_blank">Graphviz</a>. The benefit of Graphviz is that diagrams are specified textually (using a specialised markup language). We need only describe the logical structure of the diagram, Graphviz then handles all graphical layout and positioning for us (a big benefit for design diagrams which are frequently evolving).

Various Graphvis tools are available to install, we will however make use of an <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/" target="_blank">online rendering tool</a> (which avoids the need for us to install any software). You might like to take a quick look at this tool now, just to familiarise yourself with some of its features. When you first load the page you will see a sample diagram which will help illustrate how Graphviz operates. We will be using this tool to create UML diagrams later in this workbook - however, we first need to do a bit of analysis...
