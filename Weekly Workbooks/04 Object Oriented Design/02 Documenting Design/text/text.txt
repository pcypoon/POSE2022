As we shall soon see, there are many different aspects to a system's design. In order to document this design, we are going to need a mechanism to express all of these aspects in an assessable and easy-to-understand manner. A key part of this is the use of a standard set of diagrams and notations that, once trained to interpret such diagrams, any developer will be able to understand and work with. View the sides and video linked to above to find out about one such standard - The Unified Modelling Language (UML). UML is _very_ comprehensive and extensive - we will however only be using a small proportion of it in this unit. It is worth noting that other standards exist, however UML is popular and as such is the clear choice for study on this unit.
