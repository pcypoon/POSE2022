You may have identified a large number of classes, attributes and methods during your previous analysis activities. To reduce the amount of work you will need to spend on this current task, your class diagram should only include 5 or 6 of the **most important** classes and 3 or 4 of the **most essential** methods and attributes of each class. Remember that design documentation is supposed to be abstract and high level - it is _not_ intended to represent every single detail of a system. A key skill of good designer is deciding what to include and what can safely be omitted.
