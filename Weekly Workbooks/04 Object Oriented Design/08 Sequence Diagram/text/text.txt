Sequence Diagrams represent another key model from the UML standard set. View the slides and video linked to above for a discussion of the purpose of sequence diagrams and to see an example of this type of diagram in action. Ensure that you understand the purpose and nature of sequence diagrams. You are however not required to create such a diagram for the IMDB example system - we have done enough work already this week ! Do bear in mind that you may be asked to create such a diagram to document your future projects - so make sure you have a clear understand of them at this stage.
