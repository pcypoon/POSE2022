The first stage towards specifying the requirements for a system is to identify the key stakeholders involved with that system. These may include those individuals who interact directly with a system, as well as individuals and organisations that are indirectly impacted by the operation of that system.

View the slides and video linked to above in order to find out more about stakeholder identification. With the knowledge you have gained, your task is to identify a range of stakeholders for a particular system. The case study system that we use for the workbooks in this unit is the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">Internet Movie Database (IMDB) website</a>. You may already be familiar with this site (this is one of the main reasons we have chosen it !). If you haven't used IMDB before, it might be an idea to spend a bit of time exploring it to understand what features it offers.

Once you have an understanding of the features of IMDB, try to identify an initial set of stakeholders for the site. For each stakeholder, record their name and a short but clear description of their involvement with the system. Submit your suggestions via <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMDJSOTlHTk5TNDUxNlg4OUZJVlZZMjIwSy4u" target="_blank">this online form</a> - we will discuss the ideas that people have come up with in the next Q&A session !
