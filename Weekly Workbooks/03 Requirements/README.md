## Requirements

### Task 1: Introduction

Requirements analysis is a fundamental element of any software process - we need to understand _what_ needs to be built _before_ we can go about trying to built it. View slides and audio narration above for a high-level overview of Requirements Engineering and for an explanation of why this activity is essential to the success of systems development. Once you have a grasp of the key concepts, move on to attempt the subsequent tasks in this workbook.

### Task 2: Stakeholders
 <a href='02%20Stakeholders/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='02%20Stakeholders/slides/segment-2.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='02%20Stakeholders/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

The first stage towards specifying the requirements for a system is to identify the key stakeholders involved with that system. These may include those individuals who interact directly with a system, as well as individuals and organisations that are indirectly impacted by the operation of that system.

View the slides and video linked to above in order to find out more about stakeholder identification. With the knowledge you have gained, your task is to identify a range of stakeholders for a particular system. The case study system that we use for the workbooks in this unit is the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">Internet Movie Database (IMDB) website</a>. You may already be familiar with this site (this is one of the main reasons we have chosen it !). If you haven't used IMDB before, it might be an idea to spend a bit of time exploring it to understand what features it offers.

Once you have an understanding of the features of IMDB, try to identify an initial set of stakeholders for the site. For each stakeholder, record their name and a short but clear description of their involvement with the system. Submit your suggestions via <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMDJSOTlHTk5TNDUxNlg4OUZJVlZZMjIwSy4u" target="_blank">this online form</a> - we will discuss the ideas that people have come up with in the next Q&A session !

### Task 3: User Stories
 <a href='03%20User%20Stories/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='03%20User%20Stories/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Once we have identified a set of stakeholders, we can start to think about what these individuals and organisations might need from a system. There are various approaches that we can use to think about (and then document) these kinds of functional needs. Take a look at the slides and video linked to above to gain an understanding of the concept of "User Stories". 

Considering the IMDB website example, provide at least three user stories for the "standard" user (home film viewer or cinema goer). You should submit your suggestions via <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMDJSOTlHTk5TNDUxNlg4OUZJVlZZMjIwSy4u" target="_blank">this online form</a>. Be sure to enter your User Stories in the following standard format:

| Standard format: | as a `<type of user>`, I want to `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>` |
|:-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|

### Task 4: Flow Steps
 <a href='04%20Flow%20Steps/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='04%20Flow%20Steps/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

User Stories are very useful when specifying the requirements of a system in that they define high level functions that the system should perform. It is however essential that we break these down into a set of lower-level, finer-grained "flow steps". These "bite-sized" features are much easier to assign to developers and then implement and evaluate. View slides and video linked to above to find out about the concept of flow steps and to see an example of how a user story can be broken down.

Once you have gained this knowledge, think about the flow steps involved in one of your user stories. Pick a suitable user story and then decompose it into a sequence of flow steps. Enter the user story and steps into the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMDJSOTlHTk5TNDUxNlg4OUZJVlZZMjIwSy4u" target="_blank">online form</a>. Try to include alternative and exceptional flows (if you can think of any !).

### Task 5: Elicitation
 <a href='05%20Elicitation/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='05%20Elicitation/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

We have talked about how we might go about documenting system functions and features (using User Stories and Flow Steps). However, how should we go about identifying these in the first place ? In the previous tasks of this workbook, this was done by reflecting on personal experiences of using IMDB. This process is however a little ad-hoc and unsystematic. It also helps that the IMDB system is fairly familiar to a most people. In a real development situation, we would ideally want to tackle this activity systematically and rigorously in order to try to ensure a complete and comprehensive set of User Stories.

View the slides and video linked to above in order to find out more about various techniques for identifying User Stories. For each of the different techniques described, identify examples of what documents/systems/people you might investigate when analysing the IMDB system. Enter your ideas into the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMDJSOTlHTk5TNDUxNlg4OUZJVlZZMjIwSy4u" target="_blank">online form</a>. We will discuss these in the next Q&A session.

### Task 6: Problems

Undertaking requirements analysis is by no means straight-forward (even if you know that you are supposed to be doing). Take a look at the slides and video narration above to gain an understanding of some of the problems and challenges you might face. It is worth spending a bit of time thinking about these issues - we will return to some of them later in this unit (and in the summer project !).
