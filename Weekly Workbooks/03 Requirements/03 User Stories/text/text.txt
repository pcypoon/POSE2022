Once we have identified a set of stakeholders, we can start to think about what these individuals and organisations might need from a system. There are various approaches that we can use to think about (and then document) these kinds of functional needs. Take a look at the slides and video linked to above to gain an understanding of the concept of "User Stories". 

Considering the IMDB website example, provide at least three user stories for the "standard" user (home film viewer or cinema goer). You should submit your suggestions via <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMDJSOTlHTk5TNDUxNlg4OUZJVlZZMjIwSy4u" target="_blank">this online form</a>. Be sure to enter your User Stories in the following standard format:

| Standard format: | as a `<type of user>`, I want to `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>` |
