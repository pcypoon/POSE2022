We have talked about how we might go about documenting system functions and features (using User Stories and Flow Steps). However, how should we go about identifying these in the first place ? In the previous tasks of this workbook, this was done by reflecting on personal experiences of using IMDB. This process is however a little ad-hoc and unsystematic. It also helps that the IMDB system is fairly familiar to a most people. In a real development situation, we would ideally want to tackle this activity systematically and rigorously in order to try to ensure a complete and comprehensive set of User Stories.

View the slides and video linked to above in order to find out more about various techniques for identifying User Stories. For each of the different techniques described, identify examples of what documents/systems/people you might investigate when analysing the IMDB system.

We will discuss these in the next Q&A session.
