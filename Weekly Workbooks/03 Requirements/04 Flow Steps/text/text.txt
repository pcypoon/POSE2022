User Stories are very useful when specifying the requirements of a system in that they define high level functions that the system should perform. It is however essential that we break these down into a set of lower-level, finer-grained "flow steps". These "bite-sized" features are much easier to assign to developers and then implement and evaluate. View slides and video linked to above to find out about the concept of flow steps and to see an example of how a user story can be broken down.
