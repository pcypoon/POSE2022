Now that we have an abstract overview of software development, let's dig a little deeper to gain further insight. View the slides and video linked to above to find out more about the key activities involved in the software lifecyle.

In order to gain an understanding of the level of knowledge and experience of students on this unit, complete question 3 of <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMTc4QjBQUEVNTEZNVThPMDZMQTNBVTBGMy4u" target="_blank">the online form</a> indicating which activities you have previously _undertaken yourself_. It is worth noting that many of these activities we have done for you in previous units - for example, specifying system requirements, providing designs for you to implement or writing test cases for you to use to assess your work. You should indicate your own personal level of prior experience in undertaking these tasks, not just on the units of this programme, but as a result of any previous development work you have undertaken.
