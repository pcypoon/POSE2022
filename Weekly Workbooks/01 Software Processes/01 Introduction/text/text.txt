This set of workbooks will guide you through the Software Engineering content of this unit. Their aim is to introduce key theoretical concepts and then provide practical activities for you to apply your freshly gained knowledge. Work your way through the workbooks, viewing the slides and watching the video lecture segments where relevant, attempting the practical activities when requested.

Some tasks will require you to fill out an anonymous online form - responses entered here will provide the basis for discussion in subsequent teaching sessions. It is important to embrace these activities fully - they are an opportunity to engage with teaching materials and think about the subject in more depth. Without them, you won't gain any first-hand insight into the topics being discussed (which will cause problems later on during the assessment for this unit !)

Note that this week's workbook is very "lightweight" - there is limited teaching material presented and only fairly straight-forward activities for you to undertake. This is because this is only the first week of the unit and we wish to give you time to become familiar with the structure and organisation of the unit before the main body of teaching begins. Future weeks' workbooks will be more substantial and require a greater time commitment on your part - both within the sessions and in your own study time.
