You final task this week is to register with GitHub (if you haven't done so already). Your GitHub account might be useful beyond the end of your degree, so it would make sense to register a "professional" sounding username ! Ensure that you apply for a student account (since you will get a bundle of privileges that we will need later). Note that it should be possible to "upgrade" to a student account, even if you have already registered with a standard account. Once you have registered, enter your GitHub username in the final section of <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMTc4QjBQUEVNTEZNVThPMDZMQTNBVTBGMy4u" target="_blank">the online form</a>, so that we can invite you to the POSE organisation - you are going to need access to various resources in this private organisation for future activities on this unit.
