## Software Processes
### <a href='https://web.microsoftstream.com/group/47ff5be4-af38-493f-a1c8-650acc485651?view=videos' target='_blank'> Weekly Briefing ![](../../resources/icons/briefing.png) </a>
### Task 1: Introduction


This set of workbooks will guide you through the Software Engineering content of this unit. Their aim is to introduce key theoretical concepts and then provide practical activities for you to apply your freshly gained knowledge. Work your way through the workbooks, viewing the slides and watching the video lecture segments where relevant, attempting the practical activities when requested.

Some tasks will require you to fill out an anonymous online form - responses entered here will provide the basis for discussion in subsequent teaching sessions. It is important to embrace these activities fully - they are an opportunity to engage with teaching materials and think about the subject in more depth. Without them, you won't gain any first-hand insight into the topics being discussed (which will cause problems later on during the assessment for this unit !)

Note that this week's workbook is very "lightweight" - there is limited teaching material presented and only fairly straight-forward activities for you to undertake. This is because this is only the first week of the unit and we wish to give you time to become familiar with the structure and organisation of the unit before the main body of teaching begins. Future weeks' workbooks will be more substantial and require a greater time commitment on your part - both within the sessions and in your own study time.

### Task 2: Metaphor
 <a href='02%20Metaphor/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='02%20Metaphor/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

It's always nice to start with an illustrative metaphor - this helps to explain things at a high level, by conjuring up insightful imagery ! View the slides and audio narration in order to explore a suitable metaphor for Software Development.

As observed in the slides, different development companies built systems in different ways - depending on their market segment and the type of software being produced. Mobile applications are only one type of system that you may end up developing in your career. Visit <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMTc4QjBQUEVNTEZNVThPMDZMQTNBVTBGMy4u" target="_blank">this online form</a> to suggest 5 other types of system that you might have to develop. Try not to list the most obvious ones - think broadly and widely about the range of possible software systems ! We will discuss this range of applications suggested in the next briefing session.

### Task 3: Waterfall Model
 <a href='03%20Waterfall%20Model/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='03%20Waterfall%20Model/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Software Development is a complex activity and it is useful to have a high-level appreciation of the entire "lifecyle" of a software system. View the slides and video linked to above to find out about the "Waterfall Model" of software development and the various phases that it entails. With this knowledge in mind, think about the units that you studied previously in Teaching Block 1. Use <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMTc4QjBQUEVNTEZNVThPMDZMQTNBVTBGMy4u" target="_blank">this online form</a> to indicate which stages of the software lifecyle have previously been covered in your degree programme.

It is worth noting that this task is a little tricky because...

1. It requires you to understand the nature of the stages of the software lifecyle
2. It requires you to understand exactly what it was that you were taught last term !

### Task 4: Key Activities
 <a href='04%20Key%20Activities/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/slides.png) </a> <a href='04%20Key%20Activities/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

Now that we have an abstract overview of software development, let's dig a little deeper to gain further insight. View the slides and video linked to above to find out more about the key activities involved in the software lifecyle.

In order to gain an understanding of the level of knowledge and experience of students on this unit, complete question 3 of <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMTc4QjBQUEVNTEZNVThPMDZMQTNBVTBGMy4u" target="_blank">the online form</a> indicating which activities you have previously _undertaken yourself_. It is worth noting that many of these activities we have done for you in previous units - for example, specifying system requirements, providing designs for you to implement or writing test cases for you to use to assess your work. You should indicate your own personal level of prior experience in undertaking these tasks, not just on the units of this programme, but as a result of any previous development work you have undertaken.

### Task 5: GitHub Organisation


You final task this week is to register with GitHub (if you haven't done so already). Your GitHub account might be useful beyond the end of your degree, so it would make sense to register a "professional" sounding username ! Ensure that you apply for a student account (since you will get a bundle of privileges that we will need later). Note that it should be possible to "upgrade" to a student account, even if you have already registered with a standard account. Once you have registered, enter your GitHub username in the final section of <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG37h-tXTP5NGqEknVplKlalUMTc4QjBQUEVNTEZNVThPMDZMQTNBVTBGMy4u" target="_blank">the online form</a>, so that we can invite you to the POSE organisation - you are going to need access to various resources in this private organisation for future activities on this unit.
